# A Brief Review of Off-policy RL Methods from a Perspective of Sampling

> In this article, I want to give some of my opinions on the off-policy 
methods in RL. Basically, what I want to discuss is the importance
sampling and its application in off-policy methods.

## A Brief Recap on Off-policy Methods


## 1st Case: Importance Sampling in Monte Carlo Methods

## 2nd Case: Why there isn't Importance Sampling in *one-step* Off-policy Temporal Difference Methods

## 3rd Case: Importance Sampling in *n-step* Off-policy TD Methods

## 4th Case: *n-step* Off-policy TD methods without Importance Sampling

## 5th Case: A Unified Point of View
